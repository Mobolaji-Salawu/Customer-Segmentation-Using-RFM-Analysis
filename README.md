# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis
This purpose of this project is to segment the customers of a fictitious company into various customer segments using the RFM analysis method. The datasets and Jupyter notebook used in this project are included in this repository.
## Introduction
In the dynamic landscape of business and marketing, understanding customer behavior is pivotal to crafting personalized strategies that resonate with individual preferences and needs. Customer segmentation, a fundamental aspect of targeted marketing, has evolved with the advent of sophisticated data analytics techniques. Among these, **RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value) analysis** stands out as a powerful method for businesses seeking to unlock valuable insights from their customer transaction data.

RFM analysis, a time-tested approach originating from direct marketing and retail, breaks down customer behavior into three essential dimensions:
* ***Recency*** – how recently a customer made a purchase
* ***Frequency*** – how often has the customer made purchases over a specified period of time
* ***Monetary Value*** – what is the total value of these purchases over the defined time period
By examining these key parameters, businesses can categorize their customer base into distinct segments, each revealing unique patterns and characteristics.
## Methodology
### Data
The RFM analysis was done using the customer transaction data of a fictitious company.
### Python Libraries
The following Python libraries were used in this project:
* Numpy – For multi-dimensional array, matrix data structures and, performing mathematical operations
* Pandas – For storing and manipulating structured data. Pandas' functionality is built on NumPy
* Matplotlib - For creating data visualization
* Seaborn - For creating visualization. Seaborn's functionality is built on top of Matplotlib
* datetime - For working with dates and times
### Process
The main stages of the project is summarizsed in the flow chart below:

## Results
Using the RFM analysis method, the customers were grouped into various customer segments based on the how recent a purchase was made (**Recency**), how many times purchases were made over the two-year period (**Frequency**), and the total amount purchased over the same time frame (**Monetary Value**). The segments were ranked, from the highest value to the lowest value customer segment.
